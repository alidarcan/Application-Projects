## Requirements

### <ins>Must be completed</ins>:

- The site should always take 100% height and 100% width of the viewport.
- HEADER and FOOTER are always visible.
- TEXT FORM FIELDs are text input fields and are part of a single form (any value is valid). All
fields are required. Validation errors are optional.
- If the form is invalid SUBMIT button should be disabled.
- If the form is empty, the RESET button should be disabled.
- In mobile mode the site should look as below.
- SUBMIT button should navigate to the other component (toggle/endless loop).
- RESET button should reset the colors of the app and clear the fields.
- Each MENU ITEM should have a unique color, and by clicking on it HEADER, FOOTER and
buttons should change background color to the color of the MENU ITEM. Selected color should
remain after navigation.
- Scrolling may occur only on the BODY element (pink). No global scrolling (viewport).
- Content container should always be centered vertically and horizontally.

### <ins>Complete as much as possible in any order</ins>:

- MENU ITEMs and buttons should have a hover effect.
- SIDEBAR and MENU ITEMS have a fixed width.
- TITLE, TEXT FORM FIELD and buttons should be responsive.
- Try to keep the proportions as on the image.
- Content of each box is not relevant. Just some text (except form fields).
- Colors are optional, make your choice.
- All borders are optional. You can make them any color and thickness you want.
